You must create a mapbox account to get an api key and insert into an .env folder created in the root directory with REACT_APP_API_KEY as the key name. If you don't want to go through that mess, message me and i'll send you mine.

Clone down the repository, cd into the project directory. (front-end-capstone)<br>
And in the project directory run:<br>

`npm start`<br>
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.<br>

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.<br>


In a seperate terminal window, <br>
Inside of the api folder (api) of the app, run this command to start the database.<br>
`json-server -p 5002 -w issues.json`<br>
